Members of the organisation who are all Ekweremadu’s kinsmen also called on their son, Senator Ike Elkweremadu, to quit the senate race. The organisation’s statement was issued sequel to their meeting in Ndeaboh, Aninri Local Government Area of Enugu State on Wednesday, 29th October, 2014. According to the organisation, the purpose of their meeting was to endorse Governor Chime for the senate, and to find a proper way to inform their son, Senator Ekweremadu, not to continue with the senate race. <br><br>The members of the organisation met and debated the issue for almost three hours, and at the end a statement was drafted and read to the members in attendance. The statement was unanimously approved via a voice vote by all present. Thereafter the statement was signed by every member of the organisation present at the meeting. The statement was later made available to the press.<br><br>In the statement, the Aninri Peoples Organisation (APO) endorsed Governor Sullivan Chime for the Senate stating that Governor Chime is the best candidate to represent Enugu West Zone in the Senate come 2015. The statement listed hundreds of Governor Chime’s achievements in Enugu State, noting that Governor Chime had turned Enugu State into the jewel of the South East within a very short period. The statement also noted that due to Governor Chime’s good governance, Enugu State’s population has skyrocketed and the state’s economy has grown very strong and diversified. <br><br>The organisation’s statement further noted that Governor Chime had kept faith with the people of Enugu State, improved the lives of the people of Enugu State, developed the state tremendously, created thousands of jobs, and generally piloted the affairs and managed the funds of the state very creditably and judiciously for well over seven years. They also noted that Governor Chime was still full of potential to serve the people of Enugu State and Nigeria, and that since he could not legally continue as Governor, that it was in the best interest of all of Enugu people that he continues his service to the state in the Senate. <br><br>The organisation stressed that Governor Chime is the only accepted and electable candidate among all those that have declared interest in the 2015 Enugu West Senatorial race. They emphasized repeatedly that Governor Chime is the only electable candidate in the race, and that Chime is virtually unbeatable, therefore that any other candidate who contests against him is destined to fail, woefully. For these reasons the organisation said that it had decided to endorse Governor Chime for the Senate. They also assured that Aninri voters will vote en bloc for Governor Chime.<br><br>The organisation therefore called on Senator Ekweremadu to quit the senate race. The organisation also insisted that Senator Ekweremadu is guilty of usurping and collapsing the political space in Aninri local government area. They complained that so many of Aninri’s sons and daughters have had their political futures and ambitions delayed and denied because of Ekweremadu’s greed and usurpation of the entire political space in Aninri local government area, and because of Ekweremadu’s insistence on holding on to the Senate seat for life. They pointed out that whatever Aninri people may have gained from Ekweremadu’s attraction of a few projects to Aninri local government area cannot justify the usurpation, denial and strangulation of the political destinies of the youth of Aninri local government area by Senator Ekweremadu. They lamented that no one in Aninri local government area has a political future anymore because Ekweremadu has virtually confiscated the political space in Aninri local government area all to himself. They lamented that even the other representative seat in Aninri local government area (the Aninri seat at the Enugu State House of Assembly) is currently occupied by Senator Ekweremadu’s younger brother (Mathias Ekweremadu) and that such was made possible by Senator Ekweremadu’s instrumentality. They also pointed out that the same Mathias Ekweremadu had been the past immediate chairman of Aninri local government area (again another monopoly made possible by Senator Ekweremadu’s instrumentality). <br><br>The organization insisted that by pocketing the political space in Aninri local government area to himself and his family, and by insisting on remaining in the Senate for life, Senator Ekweremadu has indeed destroyed political development in Aninri local government area.<br><br>The organization also insisted that Senator Ekweremadu is causing a lot of ill will and hostility to be directed against indigenes of Aninri local government area, by people from other local government areas in Enugu West Zone. They stated that other local government areas in Enugu West Senatorial Zone have been complaining that Ekweremadu and Aninri local government area have unfairly monopolized the Enugu West Senate seat. They emphasized that Senator Ekweremadu has been in the Senate for twelve long years, therefore that it is time for Senator Ekweremadu to give another person from another local government area in Enugu West Zone a chance to occupy the senate seat. Finally the organization resolved to send five emissaries this weekend to Ekweremadu to demand that he discontinue his senate race.<br><br>Speaking to the press after the meeting, the President of AnInri Peoples Organization (APO) Chief Meshach Igwekalu Chukwu said: “It is true that Senator Ekweremadu is our son, but one must face the truth. He has been in the Senate for twelve straight years! So no matter whether he has performed or not, it is simply time for him to go so that someone else can occupy that seat. It is also time for Aninri local government area to allow another local government area from Enugu West Senatorial Zone to occupy that senate seat. The Enugu West senatorial seat is not meant for Aninri local government area alone. There are other local government areas in the Enugu West Senatorial Zone and we from Aninri must allow others to also occupy the seat. The seat belongs not to Aninri alone, but to five local government areas in total (namely Udi, Ezeagu, Oji River, Awgu and Aninri). We in Aninri must therefore live and let live. Let the hawk perch and let the eagle perch and may neither the hawk nor the eagle deprive the other of its right to perch too. In Aninri, we are a very fair and cooperative people who believe in equity and justice. We are not greedy. This is why we have called upon our son Ekweremadu to bow out of the senate race to give others a chance”.<br><br>The Woman Leader of AnInri Peoples Organisation (APO) Mrs. Gladys Ezinwanne Ivoke also had this to say: “Our son, Ekweremadu, should not go back to the senate again. He has already been there for twelve years. It is not his personal property. He needs to give someone else the same opportunity that was given to him twelve long years ago. People do not know it, but we the people from Aninri, especially our youths, have suffered too much from this political monopoly and domination of one man. Again, Ekweremadu is our son, but he needs to quit the senate race, because we want to elect another Senator who will represent us better than Ekweremadu ever did. In fact we know a candidate who will perform better than Ekweremadu in the Senate. That candidate is Governor Sullivan Iheanacho Chime, and we of the Aninri Peoples Organisation (APO) have endorsed him for the senate. What Chime has done in Enugu State in less than eight years is unprecedented. It is nothing short of a miracle. In fact Enugu State has never seen an administration such as his. His achievements are amazing and uncountable. His commitment to our wellbeing has been total. We believe in him, and we believe that he will continue in this path when he gets to the senate. This is because a leopard does not change its spots overnight. Governor Chime is a tested and trusted achiever. In fact he is a phenomenon. He has turned Enugu State into a global success story. We believe in Governor Chime and we stand with him. We will go wherever he goes. We will march forward with him. Although we are Senator Ekweremadu’s kinsmen, we will vote for Governor Sullivan Chime for the Senate for Enugu West Zone. That is the truth”.<br><br>“We from Aninri local government area are behind Governor Chime. We will join the entire Enugu West Senatorial Zone to vote for Governor Chime, and as you will see, Governor Chime will win both the 2015 Enugu West Senatorial Zone PDP primaries, and the general elections by a historic landslide, just wait and see”. Chief Meshach Chukwu added.</div></table><div class=nocopy><p><b>(0)</b> (<a href="http://www.nairaland.com/newpost?topic=1973775"><b>Reply</b></a>) <div class=nl2ads><a href="/click/politics/1555" rel=nofollow><img src="http://www.nairaland.com/contents/gqktbcerv4uha102jvvys8p95i432kvz.png"></a><a href="/click/politics/724" rel=nofollow><img src="http://www.nairaland.com/contents/ndw6ahmanbfzlg39j363zhdoa39bx693.jpg"></a><a href="/click/politics/604" rel=nofollow><img src="http://www.nairaland.com/contents/4yq2qhjljblpscih245p160np42i08nt.jpg"></a></div><p> <a href="/1980755/2015-presidency-nda-isaiah-declares-today">2015 Presidency: Nda-isaiah Declares Today</a> / <a href="/1981264/n27.5m-forms-buhari-unravels">N27.5m Forms: Buhari Unravels</a> / <a href="/1981980/nigerias-economy-mercy-other-countries">Nigeria’s Economy At Mercy Of Other Countries, Says Fashola</a> <p class=small>(<a href="#up"><b>Go Up</b></a>)<p><table id=down><tr><td class="small w grad"><p><form action="/search"> <input type="text" name="q" size="32">
