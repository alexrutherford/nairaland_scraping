What if the mistress has more influence and does something horrible to her and their kids (if any)?<br><br>However, if a girl is chasing a married man who is not interested and the wifey gets to find out, the wife can warn the mistress to leave her husband alone.<br><br>Some husbands are c.razy and will send their wives parking/deal with her for harassing the mistress. I know of a story; hubby had a mistress and wifey went to beat the mistress up and tear her clothes in her school. Mistress tells hubby and they both plan to send the wife away. The mistress said she just wanted to eat 'small' out of the man but as wifey disgraced her, she must have the man all to her self and she succeeded. As at when I saw them, the mistress now wife was having the second child. (That was about 6yrs ago and I think they are still together).<br><br>Honestly, married men and women should just put it in their pants</div><p class=s> <b id="lpt27577952">7 Likes </b> <b id='shb27577952'></b><tr><td class="bold l pu"><a name="27577973"></a><a name="msg27577973"></a><a name="1973872.3"></a><a href="/1973872/confronting-mistress#27577973">Re: Confronting The Mistress</a> by <a href="/aisha2" class=user title="Location: Nigeria">aisha2</a>(<span class="f">f</span>): <span class=s><b>12:10pm</b> On <b>Oct 30</b></span><tr><td id="pb27577973" class="l pd w "><div class=narrow>About fighting for what we believe in, If the man believed in us he will fight whatever temptation.

Can you see why the man is at fault and shoulld be dealt with?</div><p class=s> <b id="lpt27580889">3 Likes </b> <b id='shb27580889'></b></table><div class=nocopy><p><b>(0)</b> <a href="/1973872/confronting-mistress/1">(1)</a> <a href="/1973872/confronting-mistress/2">(2)</a> <a href="/1973872/confronting-mistress/3">(3)</a> <a href="/1973872/confronting-mistress/4">(4)</a> <a href="/1973872/confronting-mistress/5">(5)</a> <a href="/1973872/confronting-mistress/6">(6)</a> <a href="/1973872/confronting-mistress/7">(7)</a> <a href="/1973872/confronting-mistress/8">(8)</a> <a href="/1973872/confronting-mistress/9">(9)</a> ... <a href="/1973872/confronting-mistress/12">(12)</a> (<a href="http://www.nairaland.com/newpost?topic=1973872"><b>Reply</b></a>) <div class=nl2ads><a href="/click/family/1538" rel=nofollow><img src="http://www.nairaland.com/contents/vj0zi17l0bpduzea8tgsdl4gt98wmn8h.jpg"></a><a href="/click/family/426" rel=nofollow><img src="http://www.nairaland.com/contents/r31svtma6ug1wubm6q4cvtmg0kj9kx4j.jpg"></a><a href="/click/family/1019" rel=nofollow><img src="http://www.nairaland.com/contents/1lvib9yb2ppaiovt2dpc8w7idzddntcg.jpg"></a></div><p> <a href="/8565/why-most-women-feel-uncomfortable">Why Do Most Women Feel So Uncomfortable With Their In-laws?</a> / <a href="/1233835/means-war-family-friends-say">This Means War: Family Friends Say I Cheated With Daughter.....</a> / <a href="/1001433/lack-intimacy-hubby">Lack Of Intimacy With Hubby</a> <p class=small>(<a href="#up"><b>Go Up</b></a>)<p><table id=down><tr><td class="small w grad"><p><form action="/search"> <input type="text" name="q" size="32">
