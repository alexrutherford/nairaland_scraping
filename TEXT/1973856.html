He even went to the extent of registering for a law degree simply to be better positioned to fight this and other such abuses against the Nigerian state. It is notable that he suddenly died under very suspicious circumstances after Buhari became Head of State.<br><br>Ikemba Emeka Ojukwu, an Igboman who returned from 13years exile just a little over a year then was as well locked up in Kiri Kiri Prison by meanhearted Buhari. Up till today we are not told what was Emeka’s offence.<br><br>Busari Adelakun died of ulcer because Buhari refused him to be taken out of prison for immediate medical attention.<br>The then Governor of Ogun State,Bisi Onabanjo suffered similar fate which we were told led to his untimely death.<br><br>Incarceration without any charges of Ebenezer Babatope (Yoruba, Southwest)? A publication by the same Babatope, detailed accounts of extreme harassment of Elder Statesman Obafemi Awolowo (Yoruba, Southwest) by the Buhari regime.<br><br>This included ransacking Awolowo’s home and also seizing his International passport.<br><br>Alex Ekwueme in Kirikiri Prison. Shagari is Hausa/Fulani like him while Alex Ekwueme is an Igboman.<br><br>Buhari jailed Fela Anikulapo -Kuti on trumped up charges under emergency law which prompted the sentencing judge to confess that he was ordered to do so and apologised to the late musician.<br><br>The way he jailed Lateef Jakande, Jim Nwobodo, Ambrose Ali, Pa Adekunle Ajasin, Chief Ayo Ojewumi on cases that had no foundation and allowed Awwal Ibrahim, the then Niger State governor, who was arrested in Heathrow Airport in London with 14 million pounds sterling and several millions of Niara and dollars to be under house arrest is enough evidence.<br><br>Ayo Ojewumi became blind as a result of his imprisonment over false charges and died shortly after.<br><br>Prof. Ambrose Alli also became blind as a result of this false imprisonment. When he died, he had only one undeveloped plot of land to his name.<br><br>Pa Adekule Ajasin was never the same after his eventual release and remained sickly for the rest of his life. When he died, he never had any property anywhere in the world except the one he had built from his sweat as long term teacher and school principal in Owo township.<br><br>How about the miraculous “escape” from detention of Uba Ahmed (Hausa, North) for which Buhari had no meaningful explanation. The slap on the wrist meted out to Abubakar Alhaji Alhaji (Hausa, North) for foreign exchange offences also clearly demonstrates<br><br>YORUBA VICTIMS BREAKDOWN!!<br><br>Victim 1 - Pa Awolowo had his house ransacked, passport seized he could not go abroad for medical treatment. His home in Ikenne was also surrounded by soldiers.<br><br>Victim 2 - Pa Adekunle Ajasin, former Gov, Ondo State. Arrested, sentenced to over 100 years. Pa Ajasin is known not to have spent one kobo of his security vote and had only one house to his name in his native Owo till his death.<br><br>Victim 3 - Pa Lateef Jakande, former Gov, Lagos State. Same as Pa Ajasin. Tried in kangaroo Court and sentenced to over 100 years imprisonment.<br><br>Victim 4 - Cicero, Bola Ige. former Gov, Oyo State. Sentenced to over 100 years on trumped up charges.<br><br>Victim 5 - Papa Bisi Onabanjo former Gov, Ogun State. Jailed for over 100 years. Pa Onabanjo was whisked away from hospital where he was receiving treatment straight to prison on Buhari's instructions.<br><br>Victim 6 - Bisi Akande, former Gove. Jailed on corruption charges. Now, Akande and Buhari are together in the APC. Is Akande no longer corrupt, Buhari?<br><br>Victim 7 - Fela Anikulapo Kuti. Fela received 10 years for being vocal against Buhari's regime. Buhari said then, he has resolved to deal with the &quot;fela problem&quot;<br><br>Victim 8 - Ooni of Ife. Seized his passport and prevented him from travelling abroad.<br><br>Victim 9 - Tunde Thompson. Journalist jailed for reporting against government.<br><br>Victim 10 - Tai Solarin. Jailed for speaking against the govt. Ironically, what Solarin said/wrote then and was jailed for by Buhari's regime is nothing compared to<br>things Buhari says against the present government.<br><br>Victim 11 - Ayo Ojewunmi became blind in jail after Buhari blatantly refused to release him to get medical attention. He died soon after he was eventually released<br><br>Victim 12 - Busari Adelakun suffered same fate as Ojewunmi. His ailment though was ulcer which killed him.<br><br>Victim 13 - The many many Yoruba youth slaughtered in the north in 2011 because Buhari lost the election.</div><p class=s> <b id="lpt27577350">4 Likes </b> <b id='shb27577350'> 1 Share</b><p><img class="attachmentimage img" src="http://www.nairaland.com/attachments/1822888_buharievil_jpegb6889ad7818ec1683b7cfb16957a8f4b"><tr><td class="bold l pu"><a name="27578520"></a><a name="msg27578520"></a><a name="1973856.1"></a><a href="/1973856/buharis-victims-abuse-power-human#27578520">Re: Buhari&#x27;s Victims Of Abuse Of Power And Human Rights</a> by <a href="/unclemendy" class=user>unclemendy</a>(<span class="m">m</span>): <span class=s><b>12:29pm</b> On <b>Oct 30</b></span><tr><td id="pb27578520" class="l pd w "><div class=narrow>Waiting to hear from the elders here.............................</div><tr><td class="bold l pu"><a name="27578653"></a><a name="msg27578653"></a><a name="1973856.2"></a><a href="/1973856/buharis-victims-abuse-power-human#27578653">Re: Buhari&#x27;s Victims Of Abuse Of Power And Human Rights</a> by <a href="/kokorokoo" class=user>Kokorokoo</a>: <span class=s><b>12:34pm</b> On <b>Oct 30</b></span><tr><td id="pb27578653" class="l pd w "><div class=narrow>buhari can't even win apc primaries.<br>He's dead on arrival.</div><p class=s> <b id="lpt27578653">3 Likes </b> <b id='shb27578653'></b><tr><td class="bold l pu"><a name="27578689"></a><a name="msg27578689"></a><a name="1973856.3"></a><a href="/1973856/buharis-victims-abuse-power-human#27578689">Re: Buhari&#x27;s Victims Of Abuse Of Power And Human Rights</a> by <a href="/opiaoku" class=user>opiaoku</a>: <span class=s><b>12:36pm</b> On <b>Oct 30</b></span><tr><td id="pb27578689" class="l pd w "><div class=narrow>LET HIM WIN APC PRIMARIES FIRST<br><br><br>BUHARI IS BOKOHARAM<br><br>QUOTE ME ANYWERE</div><p class=s> <b id="lpt27578689">2 Likes </b> <b id='shb27578689'></b><tr><td class="bold l pu"><a name="27579208"></a><a name="msg27579208"></a><a name="1973856.4"></a><a href="/1973856/buharis-victims-abuse-power-human#27579208">Re: Buhari&#x27;s Victims Of Abuse Of Power And Human Rights</a> by <a href="/eliteyouth" class=user>EliteYouth</a>: <span class=s><b>12:55pm</b> On <b>Oct 30</b></span><tr><td id="pb27579208" class="l pd w "><div class=narrow>What dose Buhari really have to offer?
