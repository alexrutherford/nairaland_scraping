PDP Thugs Come And Read.</a> by <a href="/laykorn" class=user title="Location: Alimosho,Lagos">laykorn</a>(<span class="m">m</span>): <span class=s><b>11:51am</b> On <b>Oct 30</b></span><tr><td id="pb27577393" class="l pd w "><div class=narrow>Dear Nairalanders,here are a couple of reasons we should all choose shoelessness over competence come 2015.<br>.<br>1)ROME WAS NOT BUILT IN A DAY: Well, we voted in the<br>Jonathan administration for four years. But what<br>really were we thinking? It is impossible to even<br>speak properly in four years. You can’t fix any type of<br>road infrastructure in four years and you just cannot<br>even articulate your programs and agenda<br>coherently in four years. Nobody does that!<br><br>2)THE LOVE OF COMMITEES: There is only one solution for all of our country's problems. GEJ has the magic wand. When you catch a cold in the morning<br>what do you do? Set up a committee. When you can’t<br>afford to pay your children’s school fees what do you<br>do? Set up a committee to find out why your earnings<br>have hit rock bottom. If Cassava bread is not the<br>favorite for most families, set up a committee to find<br>out why. Fuel is stolen at the open seas and subsidy<br>funds are been diverted by your friends? Just set up a<br>committee to probe the committee you set up few<br>months before. Never look into the findings and<br>recommendations of previous committees, just ‘dey<br>set up committee dey go’.<br>In 2015,we might never be lucky enough to find a candidate so much in love with setting up comitees for our problems.<br>.<br>3)PITY,PITY and PITY: “I am the most<br>criticized President on earth……The problem with<br>Nigeria is that people play politics with<br>everything, that is why I have not achieved<br>much….I did not cause Nigeria’s problems….”<br>President Jonathan can be so simplistic; he makes<br>Reuben Abati so proud. And we should all appreciate<br>this rare occurrence on our Planet. Gratitude should<br>be the least we could offer. It will be difficult to find<br>anyone else this ‘simple’ and who courts so much<br>pity, in 2015.<br>In 2015, just few days to the polls, he will ask us to<br>pity him and say something along these lines: “ I am<br>running for office again because you all criticized me<br>so badly four years ago. Don’t you feel some ounce of<br>pity towards me and my people? I am from a<br>minority tribe. Please pity me some more… and vote<br>for me…It will take a while before my part of the<br>country gets another shot at the Presidency .” And<br>then he will sob. If ‘simplicity’ is what you love, kindly<br>vote for President Jonathan again in 2015, and thank<br>me later.<br>.<br>4)BOKO HARAM ARE OUR SIBLINGS: President Obama<br>referred to his challenger for the office of the<br>President, Republican Mitt Romney, as a man who<br>“shoots first and aims later”. President Goodluck<br>Jonathan aims and shoots in one fell swoop and we<br>want him back in office as our President in 2015. He<br>is that good a sharp shooter!<br>The dreaded Islamic militia group, Boko Haram, are<br>our friends….ooops….our sisters and brothers, our<br>President reminded us glibly a few months ago. The<br>problem with these variant of ‘siblings’ is that they<br>are wiping out their own ‘siblings’ in the North of the<br>country and have made sure that industrialization<br>and commerce takes flight from the land of their<br>‘siblings’. Sibling rivalry at its murderous, you may<br>say.<br>A man who fetes terrorists? Please vote for him again<br>in 2015. He is our man!<br>.<br>4)THE LOVE OF CHILDREN/CHILDLIlKE CANDOR: When was the last time we had a<br>President who spoke with such candor, cathartic<br>fervor and fecklessness? My memory could be<br>unreliably poor, but Obasanjo was so crude he slept<br>with his son’s wife. Buhari hated corruption and<br>indiscipline, Gowon handed us some of the best<br>Federal infrastructure and Shagari left behind his<br>trademark cap as a fashion item for generations.<br>President Jonathan makes you feel you can touch<br>him…the same way you can touch and feel a child. He<br>cried like a child when he arrived Lagos to assess a<br>National disaster, blames everyone else for his<br>troubles like a child would and holds aloft a loaf of<br>Cassava bread during Council meetings like a child.<br>Don’t we all love children normally? I love this man!!!<br>Any candidate who appears on the stomp grounds i<br>2015 wearing no shoes and who doesn’t have diaper<br>on like a child will not get our votes. And I mean this.<br>.<br>6)PROMISSORY NOTES PRESIDENT: On the campaign<br>trail in 2010, President Jonathan promised us<br>everything under the sun—he vowed to tackle<br>erosion in the East, to address the falling standard o<br>education, to deal with corruption, to bequeath<br>Nigerians with a Southern link bridge and to contain<br>the crisis in Jos. Recently, he has promised to ‘crush’<br>Boko Haram and to prosecute Subsidy thieves. No<br>thief of note is facing the law. Some of them recently<br>made the shortlist of National Awards recipients.<br>The trouble with Nigerians is that we do not possess<br>Patience as a virtue. The President married one, so<br>he is better placed to understand the ramifications.<br>We just have to be patient. Only last month, he<br>promised to proceed on some exile if a certain<br>bridge linking the South South to the South West of<br>Nigeria was not constructed under his watch. Never<br>mind that feasibility studies on the said project may<br>not have been carried out.<br>Never mind, we should do with some promissory<br>notes now and again from the Presidency. Some<br>music to our ears now and again won’t hurt, will it?<br>We really have to vote for this man again in 2015,<br>because he will let us see the promise land from a<br>distance but may never take us there. Here we are<br>with our own Moses at our beck and call—a Moses<br>who never delivers. Let’s adore him and vote for him<br>again in 2015. He is the real deal.<br>.<br>7)BLESSED ART THOU AMONG WOMEN: The President’s<br>spokesman reminded us of how the womenfolk hav<br>never had it so good in Nigeria’s history. He was<br>right. President Jonathan loves his women, especiall<br>those in his kitchen cabinet ( they may not<br>necessarily be cooking for him, though) and he loves<br>them in all shapes and sizes. He loves his Dame, his<br>DAM and his Stella. And he leads the way in proving<br>to the whole world that our country will be a boring<br>place without women.<br>He adores his women so much, he never fires them.<br>They may have been caught with their hands in the<br>cookie jar, but not to worry, women are….<br>well….women. They may have supervised subsidy<br>heists and air disasters…they may even be flying to<br>Dubai to shop at tax-payers’ expense, but he indulge<br>them all.<br>In a world where women are fighting for all kinds of<br>empowerment, including ‘Pounded Yam’ Rights, the<br>President is showing us all that this can be done–<br>that loving women will lead our country to a better<br>place. And he is leading by example. Vote for<br>Goodluck Jonathan in 2015. Please do, because you<br>love a woman. And don’t you say that you don’t!<br>.<br><img src="http://www.nairaland.com/smileys/cool.gif" alt="cool" border="0" class="smiley"/>BORING SPEECHES? BRING THEM ON!: My secondary<br>school teacher always reminded us of the power in<br>words and in public speeches. Thankfully, none of<br>our leaders attended my school in the countryside. I<br>can’t recall a Nigerian leader who touched my heart<br>with his oratorical prowess. President Jonathan is<br>happily no different. If you feel like a nap while at<br>work, make your way to YouTube and search for<br>some of our President’s speeches. We don’t need<br>good speakers in our political space. We love them<br>drab—very drab.<br>During the last Presidential debates, a certain<br>Candidate Jonathan dodged sparring with the rest of<br>the contestants and only appeared a few days late to<br>deliver one of the most boring monologues in<br>Presidential campaign history. We learned that his<br>remarks at the time were read from a prepared text.<br>Nigerians waved him on to Aso Rock months later fo<br>his reward.<br>In 2015, we will need more of the same: colorless<br>politicians who cannot address a classroom of ten<br>people with some eloquence let alone inspire a<br>depressed citizenry with words. And should we be<br>looking for other Candidates who cannot deliver a<br>good speech when we have Goodluck Jonathan here<br>with us? Why should we ‘dull’? American politicians<br>keep us awake during the wee hours with some<br>wonderful speeches. Who needs those speeches<br>here? Certainly not us. We have so many leaders who<br>ply their trade for ‘Dundee United’ on our shores and<br>we love them just fine. They are no albatrosses. In<br>2015, we will make sure we vote them back in as<br>Presidents, Governors and Chairmen, thank you.<br>NB: If you think you just read this piece in error, you<br> may want to refresh the page.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>NB: JUDE EGBAS SAID IT ALL! <br>Tags: berem<br>.<br>I LOVE GMB...Sai Buhari 2015</div><p class=s> <b id="lpt27577393">16 Likes </b> <b id='shb27577393'></b><tr><td class="bold l pu"><a name="27579091"></a><a name="msg27579091"></a><a name=
